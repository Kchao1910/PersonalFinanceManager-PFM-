# PersonalFinanceManager-PFM-

This web application allows a user to create a monthly budget by defining categories, budgets, and expenses. As an option, users can download a csv file of their budget.

# Introduction
PFM uses elements such as drop-down lists, input boxes, and buttons to create a dynamic web page. First, the user selects a month from the drop-down list. Second, the user can dynamically generate new categories by clicking on the green '+' button located near the top-right part of the web page. Third, the user enters in the category name(s), budget(s), and expenses. Fourth, the user must click on the 'Submit' button to calculate and display their monthly budget.
